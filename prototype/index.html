<p> The day I signed up for Progamming 1, I was excited to begin the journy of my dreams, I was excited to actually take a class where I would be able to finally start coding. For me coding has always been 
  the excitement of my life. But there was only one problem. I had never coded before in my life. I was attracted towards Coding and Progamming because I knew through Coding I would be able to design. To be an artist, 
  and to create things with my own hands. Creating beautiful websites, robots, programs to help companies, <em>Video Games</em> and all sorts of really awesometimes. But In order to get to that point, I had to start somewhere, and that somewhere was
  learning the very very basics of coding. Whether it was HTML, Python, Javascript, C, or C++ I had heard of them all, but Never once Did I know what they really meant. I started my first class in the summer of 2024 at the University of Arkansas- Little Rock. 
  And knowing nothing about Programming 1, other than that I will learn to code, I decided to take the few weeks between the day I signed up and the day classes began, to try to learn on my own, and I learned Python.....
</p>

<p>The Python course online started out easy, but really quickly it turned hard, as the code became longer and more logic got involved. I started to realize that this is not all fun and games and that it really will take a long 
  time to get better at this new passion of mine. I learned about functions, and the syntax of Python knowing that once class starts I will have an upper hand and will know atleast "first 3 weeks" of what the teacher will teach. Boy was I wrong. 

  <h3>First day of class </h3>
  <p> The first day of class came, and I was excited and knew that this will be an <strong>easy peasy</strong> python class. But within 5 minutes of the class my dreams were shattered and everything I had learned went down the drain. <q>So that I thought</q></p>
It was a c++ class and we were going to be learning C++. I knew nothing about C++, all I knew was that it was the hardest programming language out there, and that nobody starts out with c++ because that simply would just be <q>crazy to do </q> But I struggled through the first week, 
learning the basics of what <em>Int main()</em> means and what preprocessor directives were, and why the program returns <em>0</em> at the bottom of int main(). </p>
We were all given a schedule for the whole course, and within it were listed many of the topics that we would be studying.

<div id ="Brief Intro lists"
<h5>Brief Intro regarding each topic</h5>
<dl>
  <dt>Functions</dt> 
  <dd>A function in C++ is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. It can take inputs, process them, and return an output. Functions help organize code, promote reusability, and improve readability.</dd>

  <dt>Enums</dt>
  <dd>Enums are user-defined data types that consist of a set of named integral constants. They are useful for representing a collection of related values, improving code readability and maintainability.</dd> 

  <dt>Vectors</dt> 
  <dd>Vectors are dynamic arrays provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) that can grow or shrink in size. They allow you to store a collection of elements, manage them easily, and access them efficiently.</dd>

<h3>The Summer Sprint</h3>
 <p>As it was a sprint Summer course, I did not have 3-4 months to learn all the information, I had 24-48 hours between each new topic to learn, with assignments due 7 days a week, non stop for 1 month. It was demanding, I would cry, and feel demoralized, but I did not give up. I had one amazing site to help me. It was a website the professor
  used as our textbook. It was called <a href = "https://www.learncpp.com/ ">Learncpp.com</a> and I read the content on that website over and over and over ... until finally I understood each section. 
  I was tired but I knew that I will not give up, and that no matter what, I will someday learn programming.</p>

 <h3> I loved it </h3>
 <p> I did not think that I would fall in love with a subject so difficult and hard to understand, but I did. I realized that with consistency and harrd work everything is possible. I knew that by the end of the class. I had learned so much. 
  From day 1 to day 30 I had learned an unbelievable amount of things. 
  Things that I thought I would never understand. </p>
