  <div id = "header"><h3>Thoughts on Accesibility</h3></div> <!--this div is for header-->
  <div id = "content">
  <p>I believe accesibility is a major concern and with the global population over 8 billion people and internet via handheld devices and computers reaching far 
    into the hands of nations where it was inaccesible just a mere decade ago means more humans are watching, reading and using content on the internet. While we may not
    think twice while scrolling through a website, we may not realize how that accesible that website is for someone with a disibility or someone who does not understand 
    the language. Certain meaningful tactics can be deployed to help with situations like this. 
  </p>

  <h4>Language Barriers</h4>
  <p>For instance using icons not just merely for presentation but as content will 
    help people to an extent who do not understand the language on a site. For instance a caution symbol is not only for presentation while it is written alongside the words
    CAUTION, if the viewer can not understand what CAUTION means but can solely rely on the icon to alert them. </p>

  <h4>Disabilities</h4>
<p> I agree with Derek Featherstone when he stated that websites must also think thoroughly before designing so that people
  with disabilities can also benefit. For instance using high contrast in css disappears. HTML is a much better option for icons. People with visual concerns may have
  their contrast settings different and may have trouble viewing icons. Many people use keyboards instead of a mouse but that creates a major hurdle 
  as most buttons, scrolling and zoom features on websites rely heavily on the use of a mouse. Derek worked on many Hacks utilizing Dragon, Greasemonkey and other software to help integrate 
  keyboard access along with voice recognition to help tweak sites such as youtube or google maps to be more accesible. 
</p>
<h4>ARIA</h4>
<p>ARIA which stands for accesible rich internet applications. Which helps create a better user experience for people with disabilities. It utilizes the help from Dragon and other assistive
  devices to help better voice recognizition. For instance creating roles for elements which can be really helpful while using Dragon.Another way ARIA can help 
is by using better navigation by having defined sections through out big websites to help ease the navigation process.  </p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I believe it is an excellent step in the right direction to start thinking about websites from the point of view of those who are disabled while designing the site. This is a great idea 
  not just for profit and to bring in more viewers but also a humane thing to do. If people can feel like they can have access to more websites and that their disiblity or their lack of understanding 
a particular language does not stop them from being part of an online community, then they are more likely to have better self confidence and thus a more positive outlook at life.  </p>
