  <div id = "header"><h3>Thoughts on Accesibility</h3></div> <!--this div is for header-->
  <div class = "containery">
    <section id = "firsty">
  <p>I believe accesibility is a major concern and with the global population over 8 billion people and internet via handheld devices and computers reaching far 
    into the hands of nations where it was inaccesible just a mere decade ago means more humans are watching, reading and using content on the internet. While we may not
    think twice while scrolling through a website, we may not realize how that accesible that website is for someone with a disibility or someone who does not understand 
    the language. Certain meaningful tactics can be deployed to help with situations like this. 
  </p>

  <h4>Language Barriers</h4>
  <p>For instance using icons not just merely for presentation but as content will 
    help people to an extent who do not understand the language on a site. For instance a caution symbol is not only for presentation while it is written alongside the words
    CAUTION, if the viewer can not understand what CAUTION means but can solely rely on the icon to alert them. </p>

  <h4>Disabilities</h4>
<p> I agree with Derek Featherstone when he stated that websites must also think thoroughly before designing so that people
  with disabilities can also benefit. For instance using high contrast in css disappears. HTML is a much better option for icons. People with visual concerns may have
  their contrast settings different and may have trouble viewing icons. Many people use keyboards instead of a mouse but that creates a major hurdle 
  as most buttons, scrolling and zoom features on websites rely heavily on the use of a mouse. Derek worked on many Hacks utilizing Dragon, Greasemonkey and other software to help integrate 
  keyboard access along with voice recognition to help tweak sites such as youtube or google maps to be more accesible. 
</p>
<h4>ARIA</h4>
<p>ARIA which stands for accesible rich internet applications. Which helps create a better user experience for people with disabilities. It utilizes the help from Dragon and other assistive
  devices to help better voice recognizition. For instance creating roles for elements which can be really helpful while using Dragon.Another way ARIA can help 
is by using better navigation by having defined sections through out big websites to help ease the navigation process.  </p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I believe it is an excellent step in the right direction to start thinking about websites from the point of view of those who are disabled while designing the site. This is a great idea 
  not just for profit and to bring in more viewers but also a humane thing to do. If people can feel like they can have access to more websites and that their disiblity or their lack of understanding 
a particular language does not stop them from being part of an online community, then they are more likely to have better self confidence and thus a more positive outlook at life.  </p>

<div id = "header"><h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3></div> <!--this div is for header-->

  <p>I was able to share my first draft of the SpaceX website with my wife, and she was actually extremely proud and happy of what I had created. I was able to devote a lot of time and effort in the first draft which I made sure followed a certain theme. The few things that my wife did suggest were that I make the home page content a bit more neat and organized instead of just having a text in a normal format. So I decided to divide the homepage text into three sections and then also added pictures with each subheading of the section. This made my homepage much neater and more presentable. I was also suggested to move the headings to the center of the screen so that the whole website has a centralized look to it. The image carousel really helped organize the rest of the pictures. But other than that I believe that my wife was satisfied with the job I had done in the first draft and I was able to address her concerns and fix them in the final version of the project. </p>



  <p> I absolutely enjoyed working on this project and I have learned so much through the whole process. When I first started the draft I had no idea what and how I wanted the website to look like, but I somehow realized that the best thing to do would be to make a website that does not have many bright colors in it but mostly has black white and gray color. I decided to make the background mostly black with the dragon in the corner. I also made the background image static so that way it did not change when the viewer scrolled down or up on the page. I sort of tried to give the website a more futuristic look by minimizing any extra colors or patterns that were not needed and tried to keep it as minimal as possible. I was able to learn a lot about creating and sticking with a set theme and color choice. I also learned a lot of css through this website making as most of the time I spent was with css in designing the website and making it look perfect. My favorite part was being able to go on my own website and actually marvel at it and realize that I created this with my own hands. </p>
  
  <p>My experience throughout the semester was absolutely amazing! I learned so much from day one to today. Even though at first it seemed daunting and nearly impossible to be able to not only learn html, css and javascript but then to also make so many websites and extra activities such as the bear and the logo activity which really made me feel great about myself once I had successfully completed the exercises. I honestly did enjoy working throughout this semester as I had many challenges but I made sure that I enjoyed every step of the process. </p>
  
  <p>Things that I did well would definitely be HTML as I believe I caught on to it very quickly. I was also able to sit and give myself time to create all the websites with a lot of patience and care. Since I genuinely enjoyed doing the work I really feel as if I learned a lot of things quickly but definitely HTML would be the one thing that I grasped quickly. I think that I also did pretty well on the following steps when I made the Star logo and even though it was different from the tutorial I was reading I feel like the end result was actually very well done and the same goes for the bear project. I had the liberty to use my own location to place the bear and I really loved doing that as I was able to design the final outcome myself. </p>
  
  <p>One thing that I would absolutely do differently if I had to start over would be to devote more time to CSS. I feel as if I struggled a lot when it came to CSS and that I may have not totally grasped the concept of CSS as much as I did with html. HTML in my mind is much more simpler than CSS which can become tricky at times. I would also like to be able to devote more time doing my projects if I had the chance to start all over again, but other than those two things I feel as if I did pretty well overall in this course! </p>

<div id = "header"><h3>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h3></div> <!--this div is for header-->

    <p>Progressive enhancement is pretty much a web development strategy that makes it easy for everyone to use websites. It makes it easy to access no matter what kind of browser or device anyone is using. The main idea is starting with pretty much a simple version of the website that works for everyone, and then progressively enhancing (adding extra features) for people who have better browsers.  This way everyone has access to at least the basic website. </p>

    <p>Progressive enhancement is extremely important because with it, everyone can access the website and it also gives a better user experience. Users who have updated browsers can enjoy animations and interactive buttons, and people with older browsers still get at least the basics. Progressive enhancement also makes it faster to run on older browsers since they only get the basic version. Being better for search engines is also a real plus because the basic content makes it easier for google and other search engines to easily read and understand the website. This way the site gets more traffic. </p>
    
    <p>Finally I would say that progressive enhancement is something that can always stay since overtime even as technology advances you can keep adding new features without having to worry about it not working for people who were using the older devices. </p>
    
    <p> This is also a very good website that I enjoyed reading on progressive enhancement </p>
